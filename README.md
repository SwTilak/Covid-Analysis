# COVID ANALYSIS
## Problem Statement

**Is there any relationship between the spread off the corona
virus in a country and how happy people are living
in that country?**

## Lets do the Analysis



In order to answer the question, we're going to work
with two data sets.

The 1st one is Covid19 Data set published by John Hopkins
University, which consists of the data related
to a cumulative number of confirmed cases in different
countries per day.


The second dataset, is a data set related to World
Happiness Report.
The world happiness report is on annual publication
of the United Nations. \
This data set consists of scores given by people who are living in different countries
to various life factors, such as freedom to make life
choices, healthy life expectancy, social support etc..

##

We're going to merge these two data sets and calculate
a measure which can help us to find the answer
to the question that we have.

## Visualization
Analysis will never be complete unless we visualize the result in terms of figures
and graphs so that everyone can understand it. \
In this task 
we used ***Seaborn*** module 


## Module Used


```bash
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

```
    

## Analysis Result
We have found a very interesting result in this analysis. \
It shows that people who are living in developed
countries are more prone to getting the infection  with compared to less developed
countries. \
We might say that this result is because off lack
of Corona test kits in less developed countries.
